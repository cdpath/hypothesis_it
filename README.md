# Hypothesis It

Annotate with Hypothesis in Safari!

## Why?

Hypothesis only offers Chrome Extension for now


## Alternative

- Using Chrome instead with [official extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek)
- Using HYPOTHESIS BOOKMARKLET (you can find it [here](https://web.hypothes.is/start/))
